    <h3 id="headline">Here's a Brief of Al-Khwārizmī's contributions:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Algebra</strong> - The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Arithmetic</strong> - Al-Khwārizmī's second most influential work was on the subject of arithmetic,Al-Khwarizmi's work on arithmetic was responsible for introducing the Arabic numerals, based on the Hindu–Arabic numeral system developed in Indian mathematics, to the Western world. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Astronomy</strong> - Al-Khwārizmī's Zīj is a work consisting of approximately 37 chapters on calendrical and astronomical calculations and 116 tables with calendrical, astronomical and astrological data, as well as a table of sine values. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Trigonometry</strong> - Al-Khwārizmī produced accurate sine and cosine tables, and the first table of tangents.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Geography</strong> -Al-Khwārizmī's third major work is his Kitāb Ṣūrat al-Arḍ ,also known as his Geography, which was finished in 833. It is a major reworking of Ptolemy's 2nd-century Geography, consisting of a list of 2402 coordinates of cities and other geographical features following a general introduction
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Jewish calendar</strong> - Al-Khwārizmī wrote several other works including a treatise on the Hebrew calendar, titled Risāla fi istikhrāj ta’rīkh al-yahūd. It describes the Metonic cycle, a 19-year intercalation cycle; the rules for determining on what day of the week the first day of the month Tishrei shall fall; calculates the interval between the Anno Mundi or Jewish year and the Seleucid era; and gives rules for determining the mean longitude of the sun and the moon using the Hebrew calendar.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Other works</strong> - Ibn al-Nadim's Kitāb al-Fihrist, an index of Arabic books, mentions al-Khwārizmī's Kitāb al-Taʾrīkh (Arabic: كتاب التأريخ‎), a book of annals. No direct manuscript survives; however, a copy had reached Nusaybin by the 11th century, where its metropolitan bishop, Mar Elyas bar Shinaya, found it. Elias's chronicle quotes it from "the death of the Prophet" through to 169 AH, at which point Elias's text itself hits a lacuna.

      <p>
        Al-Khwārizmī's contributions to mathematics, geography, astronomy, and cartography established the basis for innovation in algebra and trigonometry. His systematic approach to solving linear and quadratic equations led to algebra, a word derived from the title of his book on the subject, "The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing"."
